## File To Encrypted Bitmap Image


</div>

### Description

Encrypts a file such as Exe/Txt and stores it in Bitmap Format.
 
### More Info
 
This App doesnt have error handling. So therefore its not flawless. The encryption is not perfect but it is good enough for this app. If you can find any way to speed this program up, please let me know. its pretty simple to use. I didnt put much effort into the interface of this app, i just wanted to do the 'file into bitmap'. Please Vote Or Comment after viewing. Im not looking for quality votes. Im looking for quantity.
